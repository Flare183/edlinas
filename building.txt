In order to build Edlinas, you need QuickBasic 4.5.

Make sure that your PATH and LIB environment variables include the
QuickBasic installation directory.

Also make sure that the qb.lib file was installed; some versions of
QuickBasic 4.5 don't automatically install it.
See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/74357 for instructions.

Then, type "xcom" at the dos command line from the top-level source
directory (presumably the one containing this file).
